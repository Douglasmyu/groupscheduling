## Project Description:
Write an algorithm that takes in your schedule, your daily availability (earliest time, latest time) and
that of your group member (or members), and the duration of the meeting you want to schedule.
Time is given and should be returned in military format. For example: 9:30, 22:21. The given times
(output) should be sorted in ascending order.
An algorithm for solving this problem involves combing the two sub-arrays into an array containing
of a set unavailability, with consideration of the daily active periods.
